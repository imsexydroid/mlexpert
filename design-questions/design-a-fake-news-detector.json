We can instead use 3rd party services like scrapestack or\n    the dedicated article scraper plugin for ScrapeBox. However, there's also open\n    source web scraping libraries available such as Scrapy. Most of these tools\n    will cover our requirements and we'll be able to avoid creating our own custom\n    web scraper. The Web Scaper will be responsible for polling the top 100 news\n    sites in the US (CNN, New York Times, Huffington Post, etc). We need to establish\n    contractual agreements with news sources that don't allow web scraping.

Our storage layer will be a\n    PostgreSQL database where each row will be keyed on an article ID. The rows\n    will contain columns including the article contents and article metadata\n    such as the publication date, publisher, article length, and perhaps the\n    news article author.

When labelers log in to the Labelling Interface, the\n    queue will be polled for an unlabeled article and displayed to the labeler\n    for labelling.

We can also use additional features\n    such as the news article publisher or whether or not the article is featured\n    on a site that requires HTTPS.\n</p>\n<p>\n    LIWC extracts over 90 features for a provided text. It works by calculating\n    to which degree various categories of features are observed within the given\n    text including:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Summary Language Variables (words per sentence, tone, words with more than 6 letters)</li>\n        <li>Linguistic Dimensions (total pronouns, prepositions, conjugations)</li>\n        <li>Psychological Processes (positive/negative emotions, social references, informal language)</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    LIWC generates features by maintaining dictionaries, or lexicons, pertaining\n    to each feature category and counting the occurrences of words in each respective\n    dictionary. Numerical features are then calculated to represent the percentage\n    of the words which were allocated to each category. For instance, if there are\n    5 conjugations within a 100 word text then the conjugation feature would be\n    0.05 (or 5%).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Architecturally, when the Data Wrangler adds an article to the database we\n    can have a Change Data Capture component on the database which will add a\n    task to a queue (here RabbitMQ). A cluster of Celery workers will poll tasks\n    from the queue and perform the LIWC feature extraction. Since the lexicons of\n    LIWC are proprietary, we'll need to integrate with either the Receptiviti API\n    or work to get a custom solution of a local LIWC library so we don't have to\n    make an API call for each news article.\n\n    When a Celery worker is finished extracting features from an article, the\n    features are added to the feature store (here FEAST). FEAST has the ability\n    to generate statistics about the features such as number of missing features,\n    minimum/max/mean/mode/standard deviation of feature values, and also the\n    number of unique values across features. This will allow the system to produce\n    data quality metrics which we can create alarms around so we can readily\n    discover anomalies and data drift. The statistics generated by FEAST are\n    fully compatible with Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV) which provides\n    libraries to identify anomalies and data drift.\n\n    The logging and alarms will be implemented in the same way that we implement\n    logging in the Extensive Logging section (LogStash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana).\n</p>"

        {
            "title": "Model Support",
            "content": "<p>\n    In terms of our model, we'll need to support:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Training</li>\n    <li>Tuning</li>\n    <li>Evaluation</li>\n    <li>Hosting</li>\n    <li>Explainability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    For model training, we'll need to split a labeled feature set into a test set\n    and a training set. The training set will be used to train and tune the model\n    (with a subset assigned as the validation set for tuning). The test set will\n    be used to perform offline model evaluation.\n\n    We'll be using a random forest as our model. We'll start with 128 trees each\n    with a max depth of six. This will make the model small enough to fit in a\n    single machine and the model training should take under 1 hour to train on\n    modern dual core processors which means we don't necessarily need implement\n    model training checkpoints.\n\n    The average news article length is under 800 words and the average word length\n    in English is 4.7 characters. A UTF-8 character requires at most 4 bytes of\n    memory which means we can assume each article is on average under 15 kilobytes\n    (KB). This means a dataset of two hundred thousand news articles will likely\n    take up 3 gigabytes (GB) of memory. This data can fit in the RAM of commodity\n    hardware which means we don't need to partition our data set into chunks for\n    incremental training. This means we don't have to implement an online learning\n    process.\n\n    Since the proportion of news articles that are unreliable is so few compared\n    to those that are reliable, we'll need to account for this in our training\n    process so we avoid degraded model performance. There's commonly two techniques\n    used in the case of random forests.\n\n    The first approach to mitigating unbalanced data sets is to use class weighting.\n    To implement class weighting, we simply add a stronger weight for the minority\n    class when calculating the Gini impurity for a split - this usually results\n    in a higher rate of false positives. The second approach (and a more appropriate\n    method for our use case) is to use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique\n    (SMOTE). SMOTE generates synthetic examples within the minority class to be\n    used for training. It does this by randomly selecting a minority example and\n    drawing connecting lines between it and its nearest minority neighbors in the\n    feature space. It then generates minority examples by creating examples which\n    lie on the connecting lines. SMOTE generally produces less false positives\n    than class weighting but models generally benefit from separately trying both\n    methods and picking whichever one performs better.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For model tuning we'll need to take a subset of the training set and create\n    a validation set. This validation set will be used to tune the hyperparameters\n    of the random forest model. These hyperparameters can include max tree depth,\n    number of trees, max number of leaf nodes, minimum impurity decrease for a\n    split, minimum samples in a leaf, minimum samples required to perform a split,\n    and the max number of features to evaluate at each split.\n\n    To search for the optimal hyperparameters in an efficient way, we'll use\n    bayesian hyperparameter tuning.\n\n    After tuning is complete, we need to serialize the model and save it to a\n    model store for hosting or for later reference.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Evaluating the performance of our random forest model should incorporate\n    metrics in terms of the business as well as the model itself.\n\n    For business metrics, we can measure the number of complaints clients reach\n    out to us about and perhaps the number of defamation suits filed against news\n    articles our system deems reliable.\n\n    For model metrics, we need to be careful that we don't rely heavily on binary\n    accuracy. Since our data set is unbalanced, accuracy can present a deceiving\n    degree of high performance. Better metrics like the F1 score and perhaps\n    Cohen's kappa should be used. Cohen's kappa calculates the model performance\n    in comparison to a model which randomly predicts reliable or unreliable in direct\n    proportion to the class imbalance within the dataset.\n\n    Finally, when evaluating our model, it's important to recognize how much the\n    model helps identify fake news compared to not having the model. To determine\n    this, we can use Bayes\u2019 theorem. Assuming that the prior of fake news is 2% and\n    that our model's true positive rate is 92% and that the false positive rate\n    is 3%, we get a 38% probability of a news article being unreliable given that\n    our model predicts an article as unreliable. Compared to the 18% probability\n    of an article being unreliable given that a human predicts it to be unreliable,\n    our model is roughly twice as good as a human. We can appropriately say that\n    this is a useful model.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In terms of model explainability, we'll use Shapley values. Shapley values\n    estimate the impact that each individual feature has on the overall prediction\n    from our model. This way, when we're asked for an explanation, we can look\n    at the Shapley values of the model and the feature values for the sample in\n    question and see how strongly each feature influenced the prediction.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For model hosting, we'll need to load the tuned model into the hosting service\n    on startup from the model store (S3). As well, since clients are able to send\n    request with just URLs, we'll need to call on the Web Scraper, the Data Wrangler,\n    and the Feature Extractor in order to obtain features from the URL. This means\n    APIs need to be created around these services.\n\n    Architecturally, we can use a production Flask server to host our API.\n    A cluster of these servers will sit behind a load balancer and be equipped with\n    an NGINX reverse proxy which will send requests to a Gunicorn WSGI which\n    forwards the requests to our Flask server. As well, we'll also need monitoring\n    around our model to detect model drift. Model drift occurs when articles that\n    were at one time correctly classified are now being incorrectly classified due\n    to the changing nature of how news articles evolve. The monitoring and alarms\n    will be implemented in the same way that we implement logging in the Extensive\n    Logging section (LogStash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana).\n\n    Calling the APIs for the Web Scraper, the Data Wrangler and the Feature\n    Extractor could add significant latency for the client when they provide\n    only a URL.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Finally, we'll want to implement a mechanism (guardrails) to override the model\n    behavior in the case that we know things that the model does not. For instance,\n    The Onion is a popular satirical news publisher. With guardrails we can return\n    to the client that articles published by The Onion should not be taken down\n    and therefore should be deemed reliable.\n</p>"

            "title": "Online Model Experimentation",
            "content": "<p>\n    Even though we're only expected to build a single model, we still need to\n    support online model experimentation so we can build our confidence when\n    replacing existing logic.\n\n    We can build this element ourselves from scratch. This should include p-value\n    calculations for A/B tests or expected improvement calculations for multi-armed\n    bandits. These calculations should be based on a relevant business metric such\n    as client complaints and at least one model metric such as the F1 score.\n    These calculations can be done once we learn the true label of each article\n    in the experiment.\n\n    For A/B testing, each article within a request will be assigned to a particular\n    treatment of either the model or the existing logic. To avoid assigning the\n    same article to more than one treatment - which can happen in the case that\n    the same article gets sent to our service more than once - we'll need to\n    generate a unique identifier for each article content. In this case, we\n    can use a checksum.\n\n    Each request from the client will be accompanied by a request ID which will\n    be used to eventually associate online predictions with true labels for the\n    prediction. This will enable us to perform online evaluations of the model\n    which can be used to compare against the existing logic. True labels will be\n    generated either by a client complaint or by the guidelines established in\n    the Labelling Interface. This means that each article requested by our clients\n    will also have to be enqueued in the Labelling Interface. We can accomplish\n    by using the same Change Data Capture used by Labelling Service except we'll\n    now need to monitor the request ID table.\n\n    Architecturally, we will create another table in the PostgreSQL database\n    where each row is keyed on the request ID.
